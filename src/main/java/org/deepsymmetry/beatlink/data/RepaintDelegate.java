 * collected and reloaded later. It still needs some way to communicate which areas of the screen need
 * to be redrawn when responding to changes in playback position marker locations, so this interface is
 * used along with {@link WaveformPreviewComponent#setRepaintDelegate(RepaintDelegate)} to enable those
 * changes to be communicated to the lighter component which is hosting it.
