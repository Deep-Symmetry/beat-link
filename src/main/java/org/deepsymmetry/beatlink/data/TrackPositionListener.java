 * <p>Classes that are interested in being informed when unexpected movement or changes in playback state occur on

 * Then, whenever a player loads a new track (or the set of available metadata changes, so we know more or less about
 * tracks in any loaded player), {@link #movementChanged(TrackPositionUpdate)} will be called, with the currently
 * available position and movement information about the track being played by the player.</p>
