 * The listener interface for receiving media detail responses when the {@link VirtualCdj} has been told to ask for

 * {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.data.MetadataFinder#getMediaDetailsFor(SlotReference)} and
 * {@link MetadataFinder#getMountedMediaDetails()} methods. But if you want to obtain that information without
 * starting the MetadataFinder, you can implement this interface, register it using
 * {@link UpdateSocketConnection#addMediaDetailsListener(MediaDetailsListener)}, and then call
 * {@link VirtualCdj#sendMediaQuery(SlotReference)} yourself.
