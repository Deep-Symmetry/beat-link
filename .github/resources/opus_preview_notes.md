:construction: This is pre-release code for people who want to help test [what is going into the backwards-incompatible release that will support the Opus Quad](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link/blob/opus/CHANGELOG.md).

> Don’t download this if you aren’t comfortable testing code while it is under active development! Instead, look at the [latest release](https:///github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link/releases/latest).

The API docs for the latest Opus-compatible preview release can be viewed [here](https://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/opus-snapshot/apidocs/).
